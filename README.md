# Market Analysis: Project Overview
Evaluated historical international video game sales data to identify trends in game genre popularity, sales figures for different geographic regions, and market competitors. Findings include regional sales trends, proportion of regional sales to global sales, and top-selling video game publishers. Used Excel to filter, sort, and clean data. Generated PivotTables to create new variables and visualizations.

## Tools & Skills

* Data quality checks
* Descriptive and exploratory analyses
* PivotTables

## Purpose & Context
I was tasked to perform an exploratory analysis to answer key stakeholder questions. I was responsible for deciding on the project scope and final presentation format. This project was a part of 
CareerFoundryâ€™s Data Immersion curriculum and was evaluated with feedback by a tutor and mentor.

## Data Cleaning and Transformation
* Removed duplicates.
* Removed columns with irrelevant data.
* Imputed averages in columns for regional sales with partially missing data.
* Removed empty rows.
* Reformatted columns and values for consistency.
* Labelled blank values as "N/A".

* Develop more Shooter games to satisfy the larger European and North American markets.
* A secondary focus on Action genres to satisfy all three regions.
* Perform further analysis to address competing publishing companies in each region.
